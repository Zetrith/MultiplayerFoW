## Real Fog of War for RimWorld
Fog of war, updated to 1.4 and made compatible with the Multiplayer mod

**Download in the Releases** on the left. Currently not on Steam

Multiplayer isn't required for it to work.

### Features
(Mostly coming from the original mod)
- Multiplayer and multifaction compatibility
- Dynamic pawn field of view
- Camera and watch tower buildings

### Caveats
This mod is made with PvP games in mind and performance in normal long-term games with multiple player factions might suffer.

At the moment, there are some known issues with:
- "X marks" of forbidden items being always visible
- Building/destroying things being visible even when not in a pawn's FoV
